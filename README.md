# Edaga

A rough companion MVP to [this ARC](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/issues/86).

Note that this MVP directly queries a [free indexer hosted by AlgoNode](https://algonode.io/). In the proposal I suggest an additional layer, an aggregation layer that would handle filtering, recommendation, caching, etc; that would in turn feed the UI-layer.

The app gets built and published to Github Pages and be [viewed here](https://hashmapsdata2value.github.io/edaga/).

## Etymology
Edaga (እዳጋ, uh-da-ga) means market in Tigrinya, a language spoken in Eritrea and Tigray. It is a translation of the Latin "Forum", which originally referred to public outdoor places primarily reserved for selling goods in the Roman Empire.
