# Edaga

> [!NOTE]  
> A rough companion MVP to [this ARC](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/issues/86).  
> See the Current Message Format section.

Note that this MVP directly queries a [free indexer hosted by AlgoNode](https://algonode.io/).  
In the proposal I suggest an additional layer, an aggregation layer that would handle filtering, recommendation, caching, etc; that would in turn feed the UI-layer.

## Quickstart

### Requirements

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as a fast, all-in-one TypeScript development environment.

### Development

- `bun run dev`
- Visit `http://localhost:5173/`

### Build

- `bun run build`
- `bun run preview`

Static builds of Edaga are hosted on [Render](https://render.com/) at [https://edaga-27kn.onrender.com/](https://edaga-27kn.onrender.com/).

## TODO

> See [our issues](./issues) for all TODOs

- [x] Setup basic site that can be interacted with if you manually format out a transaction message and send from a wallet
- [x] Improve UI and make responsive
- [x] Add a text field and submit button allowing your address to submit a transaction
- [x] Add Wallet Connect integration, such that you can "log in" with it
- [x] Add a "reply" button that shortcuts into the text field
- [ ] Add up-voting (üëç) and down-voting (üëé) messages

## Message Format

To interact with this message board you need to send **_0_** (ZERO) ALGO transaction to a specific address with a message in the note field. That message needs to be formatted in a specific way. Note that it is a ZERO ALGO transaction. You will **_never be asked to send ALGO to ANYONE_**. At most you can choose to spend a higher transaction fee, to show how "strongly" you feel about something; but that transaction fee is recycled through the Algorand protocol.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This app is currently set to testnet

The specific address is controlled by Hash: [K22E7O64EMVMBVPUQ53VVXN2U4WCYL7XN6PHOYMNNEBSNM6RMMKJZ3OAMI](https://testnet.explorer.perawallet.app/address/K22E7O64EMVMBVPUQ53VVXN2U4WCYL7XN6PHOYMNNEBSNM6RMMKJZ3OAMI).

> [!WARNING]
> Once again, do NOT send any ALGO. Specify `0` (ZERO) ALGO.

At this stage of the project we are making use of the Algorand indexer's API, which has note-prefix search functionality. In the future something more advanced could be made (e.g. by fiddling with the PostgreSQL, depositing the notes into Elasticsearch, putting it behind a RedisDB Cache) but for now we just make the best of the API available.

To post a message will cost you, at least, `0.001` ALGO.

### To Post to ALL:

- `ARC00-0;a;;{Your Nickname};{Your Message}`
  - Example: `ARC00-0;a;;HMD2V;Hello World!`

Note that while you can pick whatever handle you want, your address will of course be unique and identifiable.
But feel free to try and imposter someone!

### To Post to Topic:

- `ARC00-0;t;{The Topic};{Your Nickname};{Your Message}`
  - Example: `ARC00-0;t;cooking;HMD2V;I made the loveliest pasta today`

Note that the topic name will be case-sensitive.

### To Respond to a Previous Transaction X:

- `ARC00-0;r;{Transaction ID for X};{Your Reply}`
  - Example: `ARC00-0;r;PZSXOYGMX36BAFU5MRPT6FGP5LTNWM63FT642UNT3ZOUTLTHI3KQ;SomeOtherPerson;Hello HMD2V, hope you're doing well!`

You can also "upvote" or "downvote" someone:

- :+1:`ARC00-0;l;{Transaction ID for X};{Your Nickname}`
- :-1: `ARC00-0;d;{Transaction ID for X};{Your Nickname}`
  - Example: `ARC00-0;d;PZSXOYGMX36BAFU5MRPT6FGP5LTNWM63FT642UNT3ZOUTLTHI3KQ;Hater`

## Etymology

Edaga (·ä•·ã≥·åã, uh-da-ga) means market in Tigrinya, a language spoken in Eritrea and Tigray. It is a translation of the Latin "Forum", which originally referred to public outdoor places primarily reserved for selling goods in the Roman Empire.
